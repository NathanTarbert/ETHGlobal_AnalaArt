# Anala Art

This app has a mock login to enter the app for user simplicity at the moment for the hackathon. It will connect to the Firestore database where we are pulling our Schema from.

Once logged in the user can see the NFT wallpaper created by the artist. The details page show's the image_url where the image is being stored inside Infura. The information about the art can be validated by checking the transaction hash in Kovan's block explorer.
Only the admin can add art at this stage but the idea is to build it out to allow purchasers of the app to add their own NFT's as a personal wallpaper.
